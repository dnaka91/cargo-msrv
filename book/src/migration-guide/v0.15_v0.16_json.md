# Migration Guide: v0.15 to v0.16 with the JSON output format

## Enabling json output

In v0.15, json lines output could be enabled by providing the `--output-format json` option as part of
the top level `cargo msrv` command. `cargo msrv --output-format json verify` was a valid way to specify
the output-format option, while `cargo msrv verify --output-format json` would not work, because `--output-format` was
not defined for the subcommand, `verify` in this example.

This is no longer required; `--output-format` is now a global option, so in the above examples, both cases will now work.

## Message type tag

In v0.15, json messages were tagged using a field named `reason`. From v0.16 onwards, this field has been renamed
to `type` instead. Please refer to the [JSON output format](../output-formats/json.md) page for a list of supported
messages.

## Message replacements

In this section, we will discuss the previously supported json messages, and provide suggestions of their replacements.

#### Mode

A json message with reason `mode` reported what command was running. Its direct replacement is the `subcommand_init`
message. The v0.15 `mode` message also reported about the toolchain used, and which rustup run command was used
to check for compatibility. These however are only relevant when running a command which checks for compatibility.
Since we now also have command which do not check for compatibility, such as `cargo msrv show` and `cargo msrv set`,
this was a good moment to move these fields out of this type of message. The new `check_method` message can tell you both
about the toolchain used for compatibility checks, and about the compatibility check method via its `method` field.
If this method has type `rustup_run`, then the args will contain the compatibility check arguments, previously known
as the `check_cmd`.

The v0.15 `mode` message consisted of:

```jsonc
{
  "reason": "mode",
  // The mode in which cargo-msrv will operate
  "mode": "determine-msrv" /* OR */ "mode": "verify-msrv" /* OR */ "list-msrv" ,
   // The toolchain that will be used
  "toolchain":"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
  // Command used to check a version. The key will be absent for mode 'list'
  "check_cmd":"cargo check --all"
}
```
Examples of messages which replace the information reported by the v0.15 `mode` message:

```json lines
...
{"type":"subcommand_init","subcommand_id":"find"}
...
{"type":"check_method","toolchain":{"version":"1.38.0","target":"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"},"method":{"type":"rustup_run","args":["1.38.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc","cargo","check"],"path":"..\\air3"}}
...
```


#### Installing and Checking





```jsonc
{
  "reason": "installing", /* OR */ "reason": "checking",
  // The current version being installed or checked
  "version": "1.25.0",
  // The number of versions checked before this
  "step": 0,
  // The total number of versions to be checked
  "total": 55,
  // The toolchain that is being used
  "toolchain": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
  // The command used to check each version. The key will be absent for mode 'list'
  "check_cmd": "cargo check --all"
}
```

```json lines
...
{"type":"progress","current":25,"search_space_size":34,"iteration":2}
...
{"type":"setup_toolchain","toolchain":{"version":"1.38.0","target":"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"},"scope":{"id":2,"marker":"start"}}
{"type":"setup_toolchain","toolchain":{"version":"1.38.0","target":"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"},"scope":{"id":2,"marker":"end"}}
...
{"type":"check_toolchain","toolchain":{"version":"1.39.0","target":"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"},"scope":{"id":4,"marker":"start"}}
{"type":"check_toolchain","toolchain":{"version":"1.39.0","target":"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"},"scope":{"id":4,"marker":"end"}}
```

#### Check complete

Reported when a check, which determines whether the toolchain version under test
is compatible, completes.

```jsonc
{
  "reason": "check-complete",
  // The version that was just checked
  "version": "1.25.0",
  // The number of versions checked before this
  "step": 0,
  // The total number of versions to be checked
  "total": 55,
  // true if this version is supported
  "success": false,
  // The toolchain that is being used
  "toolchain": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
  // The command used to check each version
  "check_cmd": "cargo check --all"
}
```

```json lines
{"type":"check_result","toolchain":{"version":"1.39.0","target":"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"},"is_compatible":true}
...
{"type":"check_result","toolchain":{"version":"1.35.0","target":"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"},"is_compatible":false,"error":"error: failed to parse lock file at: ..\\air3\\Cargo.lock\n\nCaused by:\n  invalid serialized PackageId for key `package.dependencies`\n"}
```

#### MSRV completed

Reported when all actions for a mode have been run to completion.

```jsonc
{
  "reason": "msrv-complete" /* OR */ "reason": "verify-complete",
  // true if a msrv was found
  "success": true,
  // the msrv if found. The key will be absent if msrv wasn't found
  "msrv": "1.42.0",
  // The toolchain that is being used
  "toolchain": "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
  // The command used to check each version. The key will be absent for mode 'list'
  "check_cmd": "cargo check --all"
}
```

```json lines
{"type":"subcommand_result","subcommand_id":"find","result":{"version":"1.38.0","success":true}}
```

#### List MSRV's specified by crate authors

Reported upon completion of listing the MSRV's of dependencies for a given crate.
The `list` output depends on the `variant`.
```jsonc
{
  "reason": "list",
  // output variant
  "variant": "ordered-by-msrv" /* OR */ "direct-deps",
  // always success when returning a result
  "success": true,
  // The output of the list subcommand
  "list": [
    /* when variant = 'ordered-by-msrv */
    {
        "msrv": "<msrv>",
        "dependencies": ["<dependencies which have this msrv>", ...]
    }
    /* OR, when variant = direct-deps */
    {
        "dependency": "<dependency crate name>",
        "version": "<dependency crate version>",
        "msrv": "<dependency crate msrv>",
        "depends_on": ["<dependencies of direct dependency crate>", ...]
    }
  ],
}
```
